# London Sewer System
The background of this project is the following: "Someone dropped a famous, expensive ring into a sewer in London. It drifted off and has to be found. Itâ€™s
a special, magical ring and can always be seen wearing special glasses. A famous diver, McDiver, is going
into the sewer system with the special glasses to find the ring. And find it McDiver does! McDiver takes off
the special glasses and heads to the exit. But now, with the special glasses off, McDiver sees coins all over
the sewer system, and on the way to the exit, McDiver picks up as many coins as possible." This description is taken from a7handout.pdf, which also contains instructions and further details for this assignment. Instructions and specificatons were provided by David Gries. Code in McDiver.java was written by me, while the rest was provided by David Gries.
There are two ways to run the program. Running from graph.GameState.java runs the program in headless mode (without a GUI); running it from gui.GUI.java runs it with an accompanying display. By default, each of these runs a single map on a random seed. For more detail on running the program, see a7handout.pdf section 7.
